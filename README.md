In order to get the data to train the model, just run "python3 data_downloader.py" in the "/data" directory. This will download the appropriate training, testing, and validation data.

Now in order to train the data, just run "python3 train_Sherlock_Preprocessed.py" in the "/model_code_files" directory. This will train the model on the downloaded data and save the model in the "/model" directory

In order to test the trained model, just run "python3 predict_Sherlock_Preprocessed.py" in the "/model_code_files" directory.
